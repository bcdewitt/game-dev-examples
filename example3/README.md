This example is the same as example 2, but we build some of the HTML/DOM using JS (See the `// Add canvas and canvas-wrapper to DOM, under .js-game-root` comment in `main.js`). This is how a lot of web apps work and it's mostly because they need to be dynamic (HTML is static) and they're JS-driven. That is, we try to organize everything into JS files and we often build them to work even if there are multiple separate JS-based apps/entrypoints in the same HTML document - we just give them different root elements to attach to. We refer to this pattern as [Islands Architecture](https://www.patterns.dev/vanilla/islands-architecture/). There are many other web app patterns to familiarize yourself that aren't important at the beginning, but this link specifically has a decent picture to understand how this tends to work and why we would want to create elements in JS like this.
